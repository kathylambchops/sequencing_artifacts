Identifying and Characterizing Sequencing Artifacts in Next-Generation Sequencing Data using Machine Learning Methods

Building pipelines with Linux shell scripting and using Slurm to submit batch jobs on the HPC of SRA pair-end data to determine variants

GIAB database used as the gold standard to determine if a variant is artifactual (came from sequencing errors from wet-lab library preparation like DNA shearing or PCR) or true variant (real mutation).
Right and left flanking regions of artifactual variants extracted and metrics generated for AT content, GC content, homopolymers, hairpin loops, kmers, palindromes, and oxidative damage.
Manipulate and work with large datasets using Pandas as well as data visualization using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook
Machine learning models built using Scikit-learn to determine if sequencing platform artifactual variants have patterns and can be classified or predicted
